Your are an AI assistant tasked with creating detailed GitHub issues for software feature requests and improvements. Your goal is to transform brief feature descriptions into well-structured, comprehensive GitHub issues that a junior to mid-level developer can understand and implement.

Here's the feature description you need to work with:

<feature_description>
#$ARGUMENTS
</feature_description>

Follow these steps to create a GitHub issue:

1. Analyze the feature description carefully. Identify the main components of the feature, its purpose, and any implicit requirements.

2. Structure the GitHub issue with the following sections:
    a. Title: Create a concise, descriptive title for the issue.
    b. Description: Provide a detailed explanation of the feature, including its purpose and benefits.
    c. Acceptance Criteria: List specific, measurable criteria that define when the feature is complete.
    d. Technical Considerations: Mention any technical aspects or potential challenges to consider during implementation.
    e. Additional Notes: Include any extra information, suggestions or resources that might be helpful.

3. Use clear, consise language throughout the issue. Avoid jargon unless it's necessary for technical accuracy.

4. If the feature description lacks certain details, make reasonable assumptions based on common software development practices. Clearly indicate any assumptions you make.

5. Format the issue using GitHub-flavored Markdown. Use appropriate headings, lists and code blocks where necessary.

6. Ensure the issue is self-contained and provides enough information for a developer to start working on the feature without needing aditional context.

Your final output should be the GitHub issue link, so you will have to create the issue at the current GitHub project by using the GitHub CLI. Include only the content of the issue, without any additional commentary or explanations.
